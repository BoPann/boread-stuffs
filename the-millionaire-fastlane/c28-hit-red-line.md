# Intelligent Risks and Moronic Risks 
Chapter 28 

## Intelligent vs Moronic
Intelligent Riks have a limited downside, while their upside is unlimited. Morinic risks often have bottomless downside while their upsideis limited or shoert-term. Flying to Vegas and gambling a month's salary is a moronic risk. Pursuing a business is an intelligent risk. The upside could be millions. The downside? You might have to live below your standards. It all comes down to what you are willing to do and not do. Risk involves careful stewardship of choice. Minimize moronic risk and take advantage of intelligent risk. 

 It is easier to live in regret of failure than in regret of never trying. 


## The Trap of "Someday I will..."
“Someday” doesn’t get you anywhere. We all want everything to be perfectly aligned, but that’s like driving down a road and hoping every traffic light is green. It’s better to start driving and stop at a few red lights than to never move at all.
