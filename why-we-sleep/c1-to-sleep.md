## Chapter 1 To Sleep

## 1/3 of our lives in Coma
Imagine the birth of your first child. At the hospital, the doctor enters the room and says, "Congratulations, it's a healthy baby boy. We've completed all of the preliminary tests and everything looks good." She smiles reassuringly and starts walking toward the door. However, before exiting the room she turns around and says, "There is just one thing. From this moment forth, and for the rest of your child's entire life, he will repeatedly and routinely lapse into a state of apparent coma. It might even resemble death at times. And while his body lies still his mind will often be filled with stunning, bizarre hallucinations. This state will consume one-third of his life and I have absolutely no idea why he'll do it, or what it is for. Good luck!”

Sleep fixes your body. Skipping it is basically driving a car without oil and hoping for the best.

>Downstairs in the body, sleep restocks the armory of our immune system, preventing infection and warding off all manner of sickness. Sleep reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose. Sleep further regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food selection rather than rash impulsivity. Plentiful sleep maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut from which we know so much of our nutritional health begins. Adequate sleep is intimately tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure while helping keep our hearts in tine condition.

## Is it worth it?
Humans are the only species that willingly deprive themselves of sleep with no legitimate payoff. Which raises the obvious question: **for what?** What are we really gaining in exchange for something so fundamental? But let’s be honest, it happens. Every time I push my sleep time, I ask myself: _Is it worth it?_
