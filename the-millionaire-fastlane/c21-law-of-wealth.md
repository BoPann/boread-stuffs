# The  Law of Wealth
Chapter 21


## Law of Effection
The law of wealth is the law of effection. \
The more people you affect the richer you will become. 

Again\
`Net Profit = Unit Sold(Scale) x Unit Profit (Magnitude)`

## What if I can't touch so many souls?
The answer is - go closer to the source of money! \
For example, the agent of a high-profile athletes, real estate broker


## Conclusion
It is important to note simply starting a business is **NOT** a fastlane. A lemonade stand business is not a fastlane **unless** it fullfills the **CENTS** framework (coming up). To get rich, one either make a giant impact a few times or make a small impact millions of times.
