## Chapter 1 To Sleep
> Sleep is great, and you should get more of it. It’s the simplest way to reset your brain and body.

>睡覺好重要，多睡覺！
睡覺是最簡單、最快的方式重啟我們的大腦和器官

### 人生有三分之一都在睡覺！
相信這個應該不陌生吧！人花了很長的時間在睡覺，甚至長達三分之一！假設我們能活到90歲，相當我們有三十年都在睡覺這個狀態裡！

> To better frame this state of prior scientific ignorance, imagine the birth of your first child. At the hospital, the doctor enters the room and says, "Congratulations, it's a healthy baby boy. We've completed all of the preliminary tests and everything looks good." She smiles reassuringly and starts walking toward the door. However, before exiting the room she turns around and says, "There is just one thing. From this moment forth, and for the rest of your child's entire life, he will repeatedly and routinely lapse into a state of apparent coma. It might even resemble death at times. And while his body lies still his mind will often be filled with stunning, bizarre hallucinations. This state will consume one-third of his life and I have absolutely no idea why he'll do it, or what it is for. Good luck!”

### 睡覺好處

> Downstairs in the body, sleep restocks the armory of our immune system, preventing infection and warding off all manner of sickness. Sleep reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose. Sleep further regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food selection rather than rash impulsivity. Plentiful sleep maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut from which we know so much of our nutritional health begins. Adequate sleep is intimately tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure while helping keep our hearts in tine condition.

### 遠離那種 toxic hustle culture
如果有人跟你說他不用睡覺，或是可以一天睡得很少但是也不影響他的健康，隔天起床還是精神奕奕。我們不知道他說的是不是對的（也許他因為沒睡好，導致分錯亂了）。但我們可以知道的是，如果你沒睡好或睡夠，你的生活品質一定不好。

> The old maxim "TIl sleep when I'm dead" is therefore unfortunate. Adopt this mind-set, and it is possible that you will be dead sooner and the quality of that (shorter) life will be worse. The elastic band of sleep deprivation can stretch only so far before it snaps. Sadly, human beings are in fact the only species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep without legitimate gain.

### 一些數據

> Tragically, one person dies in a traffic accident every hour in the United States due to a fatigue-related error.
