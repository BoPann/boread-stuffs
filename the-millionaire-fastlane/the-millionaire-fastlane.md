## Things we need to Know about WEALTH

- Fast wealth is created asymmetrically, not linearly. 
- Get rich quick != get rich easy 
- The slow lane might still get you rich, but slow... perhaps when you are in your 60s and not in your best mobility (not being able to enjoy it). 
- Trade time for the money is a trap (it might work, but not the fast lane)
- Money does grow on tree. But you need to BUILD THE MONEY TREE - [Does Money Grow on Trees?](c19-money-grows-on-tree.md)
- How to get RICH??? Seriously! [The Rich Equation](c18-how-rich-get-rich.md)
- [The Law of Wealth](c21-law-of-wealth.md) - The Law of Effection
- The body is the vehicle, so take care of it - [Change that Dirty, Stale Oil ](c27-change-the-oil.md)
- About Taking Risk - [Intelligent vs Moronic Risks](c28-hit-red-line.md)
- Are you sure you are on the fastlane? - [CENTS Framework](c29-CENTS.md)


## My notes
- Find the why
- Find the THINGS (service/ products) people need
- Be in the control (in the sense of being able to control the scale and magnitude)
- `Net Profit = Unit Sold(Scale) x Unit Profit (Magnitude)`
