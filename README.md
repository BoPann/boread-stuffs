>Hi there! 🐈‍⬛ This is where I document the readings for the people I love. I want all of us to live long, healthy, meaningful lives. That is my goal in life, and these readings are part of that journey. Most of the content will follow that theme, although I might add extra things if they seem interesting. The goal is clear, but it also stays flexible. I will write in both English and Chinese. I promise to keep it to just these two. It will probably end up mixed together depending on my mood, so bear with me.🐻 Please note that many of these entries are quick jot-down notes or works in progress. That said, it should not stop you from understanding the essence of them. If anything feels unclear, feel free to reach out :) You know where to find me. I hope you have fun reading! 💛
