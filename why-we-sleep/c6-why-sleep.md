# Chapter 6 Sleep and Memory

## Sleep to Learn 

Sleep increase the performance to learning (especially motor skill). In fact, a 20% learning advantage for those who sleep from a study the author did. 

It was the early-night sleep, rich in deep NREM, that won out in terms of providing superior memory retention saving relative to late-night, REM-rich sleep. 

### Target Memory Reactivation
Review the things you want to learn before bed can increase the chance of retaining those information. 

### Practice, with Sleep, Makes Perfect
More specifically, it is the last two hours of NREM sleep that enhance the motor skills of the participants (p127). 

## Sleep to Forget 

Memory is a limited resource and forgetting is the price we pay for remembering. Fortetting is as important as remembering. 

One a study, sleep selectively, boosted the retention of the things you want to retain and avoids the strengthening of those unwanting memories. (p121)

Perhaps the movie _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ is not so fictional after all. Maybe there are ways that we can have unwanted memories deleted by a special brain scanning machine.
