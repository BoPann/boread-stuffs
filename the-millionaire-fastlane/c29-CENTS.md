# CENTS

## Not Every Business is a Fastlane 
Like we mentioned in [Law of Wealth](c21-law-of-wealth.md), not every business is a fastlane. So... What is? 

## CENTS Framework
The book provides 5 commandments to us to examine the business. 
- The Commandment of Control
- The Commandment of Entry
- The Commandment of Need
- The Commandment of Time
- The Commandment of Scale

### The  Commandment of Control
Do you get to decide the direction of the business? Do you control every aspect of the company? If not, then—by this definition—you’re a **hitchhiker**. 

I personally think **DON'T** hithcking is bad. However, it is important to know the difference between driver and hitchhiker. 

Drivers own the vehicle. Hitchhikers ride along.\
Drivers make the decisions. Hitchhikers follow them.\
Drivers tend to make _big_ money. Hitchhikers make _good_ money.

The author is firm on this point: **you should be the driver**. You should be in control.\
Personally, I see it a little differently. I don’t think being a hitchhiker is always a bad thing—as long as it serves what _you_ need at that stage of life. Control comes with responsibility, stress, and risk, and not everyone wants that all the time.

But hey, the author is the millionaire, and I’m not so maybe you should not listen to me 😹
