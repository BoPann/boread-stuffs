## The Purpose of Life 
In Simon’s talks across various videos, he explains that the purpose of life comes from two things:
- The feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself
- Being in service of others

👉This book corresponds to the first idea — _WHY_.

It’s important to ask why we do the things we do, not just what we do or how we do them. Being able to clearly articulate the underlying motivation often allows us to connect more deeply with others. This is largely because human decision-making is not purely rational. As described in  [The Body Keeps the Score: C3 Anatomy](../the-body-keeps-the-score/c4-anatomy.md), sensory information is first processed by the limbic system, also known as the emotional brain, before reaching higher-level reasoning areas.
