# CENTS

## Not Every Business is a Fastlane 
Like we mentioned in [Law of Wealth](c21-law-of-wealth.md), not every business is a fastlane. So... What is? 

## CENTS Framework
The book provides 5 commandments to us to examine the business. 
- The Commandment of Control
- The Commandment of Entry
- The Commandment of Need
- The Commandment of Time
- The Commandment of Scale

### The  Commandment of Control
Do you get to decide the direction of the business? Do you control every aspect of the company? If not, then—by this definition—you’re a **hitchhiker**. 

I personally think **DON'T** hithcking is bad. However, it is important to know the difference between driver and hitchhiker. 

Drivers own the vehicle. Hitchhikers ride along.\
Drivers make the decisions. Hitchhikers follow them.\
Drivers tend to make _big_ money. Hitchhikers make _good_ money.

The author is firm on this point: **you should be the driver**. You should be in control.\
Personally, I see it a little differently. I don’t think being a hitchhiker is always a bad thing—as long as it serves what _you_ need at that stage of life. Control comes with responsibility, stress, and risk, and not everyone wants that all the time.

But hey, the author is the millionaire, and I’m not so maybe you should not listen to me 😹


## The Commandment of Entry
Higher entry barriers means more robust, mroe powerful road with lesscompetition and the need for exceptionality. 

It should be a warning signs If "everybody is doing it". 

Real Business startups are process, not events. For example, to open up a airbnb business in Sedona, you need to find a property, fix it, finance it, insure it, get licensing and permits, hire staff and perform about ten other steps. 


## The Commandment of Need 
Don't chase money, chase need. Money is like a cat; it eludes you if you chase it around the neighborhood. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts the cat, it comes to you and sits on your lap (meow)


What do you have to offer? 

### Concrete Advices - Make one Million People Achieve: 
1. Make them feel better (entertainment, music, video games)
2. Help them solve a problem
3. Educate them
4. Make them look better (health, nutrition, clothing, makeup)
5. Give them security (housing, safety, health)
6. Raise a positive emotion (love, happiness, laughter, self-confidence)
7. Satisfy Appetites from basic (food) to risque (sexual)
8. Make things easier
9. Enhance their dreams and give hopes

"Do what you love" often don't work. Unless: 
1. The love solves people's need
2. You are exceptional at it

"Do what you love" has 2 risks:
1. They don't make money fast
2. They endanger love


Instead, find passion, aka meaning aka purpose aka why.
