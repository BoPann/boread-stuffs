# Chapter 28 Change that Dirty, Stale Oil 

It’s common sense to change your car’s oil every 3,000 miles. Our bodies work the same way, we need fresh “oil” too. In this case, oil is **education and knowledge**. What we know today won’t be enough to get us where we need to be tomorrow.

And it’s not just the brain. The body matters too. Our body is the vehicle for this road trip called life, and if you don’t take care of it or keep putting in bad gas, we're not getting very far.

## The Classic “I Don’t Have Time” and “I Don’t Know How”

Well… find the time and learn how.

Yes, time is a scarce resource. But every time I catch myself thinking that, I ask: _Really? What about the time you spent scrolling through cat memes?_

And with the amount of **free education on the internet today**, “I don’t know how” is no longer a real excuse. Almost anything can be learned—if we’re honest about our priorities.
