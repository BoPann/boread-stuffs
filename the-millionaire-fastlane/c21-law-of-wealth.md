The law of wealth is the law of effection. \
The more people you affect the richer you will become.

`Net Profit = Unit Sold(Scale) x Unit Profit (Magnitude)`

## What if I can't touch so many souls?
The answer is - go closer to the source of money! \
For example, the agent of a high-profile athletes, real estate broker
